# Introduction
This project implements a single-cycle RISC-V CPU based on Digital Design and Computer Architecture by Sarah Harris. It supports the RV32I base instruction set and executes each instruction in one clock cycle. Written in Verilog, the design is educational and ideal for learning RISC-V architecture and CPU design basics.
